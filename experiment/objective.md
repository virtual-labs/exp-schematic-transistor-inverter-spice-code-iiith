1. To write and simulate spice codes for:  
   i. Simple Inverter  

2. To write spice code for any transistor level schematic.

3. To design transistor level schematic of an Inverter using :-
    i. Complementary CMOS logic

4. To find the effect of load capacitance on the rise time and fall time and hence delay of output waveform.  

5. To find the effect of W/L of transistors on the output waveform.
